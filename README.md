# main-bot-2017
This will be our primary robot unless the testing bot works flawlessly and provides a better system.

# Rules for editing:
 - Put all changes in your commit description
 - If you need a text editor.I recommend you install eclipse to take full advantage of it's syntax highlighting, error detection, and integrated documentation
 - Include lots of comments
 - a great person once said "good code explains itself" : use self-explanatory names, syntax, etc. and write code that is easy to read.
 - KISS = Keep It Simple Stupid
